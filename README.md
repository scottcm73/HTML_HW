### Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

## Background

This project creates a visualization dashboard website using previously created visualizations of weather data. (Resources/cities.csv).

The dashboard includes individual pages for each plot and a means to navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. A landing page, shows a comparison of all of the plots, and another page displays the data used to build the plots.

Bootstrap stylesheets are used for the pages.
